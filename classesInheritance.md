Class Inheritance
To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.

A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:

Example
Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class:

class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(brand, mod) {
    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;
  }
}

let myCar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myCar.show();

The super() method refers to the parent class.

By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods.

Inheritance is useful for code reusability: reuse properties and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
